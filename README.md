The objective of this project is to build a BB gun firing station using Heng Long BB unit. Diverging from the utilization of the brand's proprietary circuit board, this unit is instead integrated with a microcontroller UNO.This strategic integration enables control via an Android smartphone utilizing Bluetooth connectivity, offering enhanced flexibility and convenience in maneuvering and firing the unit.
